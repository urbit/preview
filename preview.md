<p class='leader'>Do you ever feel like you're using the Internet as a modem?</p>

The Internet is actually an awesome modem.  The online services are amazing.  AOL and Compuserve look downright neolithic.  But... have we really come that far from 1995?

Can we re-decentralize the Internet?  A lot of great engineers have been trying.  Maybe we can't?  Maybe it's just impossible?   Not because centralized computing has some abstract theoretical advantage -- just because of 40 years of technical and administrative mistakes that can no longer be fixed?

The Internet isn't from 1995.  It's from 1975.  In 1995, we learned that a network beats a mainframe.  Now, we've learned that a 2015 mainframe beats a 1975 network.  Does it beat a 2015 network?   Who knows?  What is a 2015 network, anyway?

The question seemed interesting.  So we built Urbit.   First, the Internet beat the modem.  Then, a modem on top of the Internet beat the Internet.  So, we made an Internet on top of the Internet...

This is actually an understatement.  The Internet/Unix stack is one system -- Unix is layer 7.  Urbit is a protocol stack that includes layer 7.  It defines the complete lifecycle of the computer.  It's a full-stack redesign of system software: a new VM, language and OS.  None of which organs bears any strong resemblance to anything from the 20th century.  If you're a geek, Urbit won't bore you.

If you're not a geek: imagine a world where instead of dialing into 12 different corporate mainframes, all competing to own you, you point your browser at your own personal server.  You own your own data. You control your own apps, which work only for you. You're one digital citizen, not 12 digital serfs.  Your network is one digital republic, not a patchwork of incompatible corporate dictators.  (And needless to say, its system software is patent-free and open source.)

Geek or not, you'll have to wait.  Urbit remains a closed network in alpha-test.  This stuff isn't easy.  Urbit is *nowhere near* ready for your grandmother.  It wants to be the Apple II of personal cloud computing.  Right now it's not quite the Apple I.

But while Urbit is very much alpha, it's very much not vaporware.  Most people haven't heard of Urbit.  Many who have think it's a hoax.  If it's a hoax, it's quite an intricate hoax:

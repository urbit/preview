<h1 class="leader">Urbit preview <code>~2015.9.24</code></h1>

<h2>What:</h2>

<list dataPath="/pub/preview/materials"></list>

<h2>Why:</h2>

Do you ever feel like you're using the Internet as a modem?

The Internet is actually an awesome modem.  The online services blow AOL away.  But are we really that far from 1995?

Can we re-decentralize the Internet?  A lot of great hackers have been trying.  Maybe we can't?  Maybe it's just impossible?

The Internet isn't from 1995.  It's from 1975.  In 1995, we learned that a network beats a mainframe.  Now, we've learned that a 2015 mainframe beats a 1975 network.

Does it beat a 2015 network?  Who knows?  What is a 2015 network, anyway?

The question seemed interesting.  So we built Urbit.

First, the Internet beat the modem.  Then, a modem over the Internet beat the Internet.  Why not an Internet over the Internet?

<h2>Also:</h2>

What is a "2015 network," anyway?  A 1975 network delegates layer 7 to the OS.  A "2015 network" (as us fools define it) includes layer 7: it's its own VM, language and OS.  The protocol specifies the complete lifecycle of the computer.

Urbit remains a closed network in alpha-test.  It's open source and patent-free.  Fork us on [github](https://github.com/urbit/urbit)!  You need an invitation to join the network.  But not to play with the interpreter, or even send a PR.

Why is Urbit still closed?  Global flag days, mostly.  And all the other woes to which human (and Martian) code is prey.  Urbit `~2015.9.24` isn't an Apple II or even an Apple I.  It's not ready for you, let alone your parents.  The system today does more or less what you see in the demos, though it's rather more reliable.  As always: we ship no code before its time.

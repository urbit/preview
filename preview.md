<h2>What:</h2>

<list dataPath="/pub/preview/materials"></list>

<h2>Why:</h2>

Do you ever feel like you're using the Internet as a modem?

The Internet is actually an awesome modem.  The online services blow AOL away.  But... have we really come that far from 1995?

Can we re-decentralize the Internet?  A lot of great hackers have been trying.  Maybe we can't?  Maybe it's just impossible?

The Internet isn't from 1995.  It's from 1975.  In 1995, we learned that a network beats a mainframe.  Now, we've learned that a 2015 mainframe beats a 1975 network.

Does it beat a 2015 network?  Who knows?  What is a 2015 network, anyway?  The question seemed interesting.  So we built Urbit.

First, the Internet beat the modem.  Then, a modem on top of the Internet beat the Internet.  So, we made an Internet on top of the Internet...

<h2>Also:</h2>

Urbit remains a closed network in alpha-test.  It's open source and patent-free.  Fork us on [github](https://github.com/urbit/urbit)!

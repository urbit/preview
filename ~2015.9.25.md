<h2>What:</h2>

<list dataPath="materials"></list>

<h2>Why:</h2>

Do you ever feel like you're using the Internet as a modem?

The Internet is actually an awesome modem.  The online services blow AOL away.  But are we really that far from 1995?

Can we re-decentralize the Internet?  A lot of great hackers have tried.  Maybe we can't?  Maybe it's just impossible?

The Internet isn't from 1995.  It's from 1975.  In 1995, we learned that a network beats a mainframe.  Now, we've learned that a 2015 mainframe beats a 1975 network.

Does it beat a 2015 network?  What is a 2015 network, anyway?

If the Internet beats a modem, and a modem on top of the Internet beats the Internet -- what if we made an Internet on top of the Internet?

These questions seemed interesting.  So we built Urbit.

<h2>Also:</h2>

What do we mean by a "2015 network?"  A 1975 network delegates layer 7 to a separate OS.  Our "2015 network" specifies layer 7 -- it includes the OS.  The protocol defines the complete lifecycle of the computer.

Urbit remains a closed network in alpha-test.  It's open source and patent-free.  Fork us on [github](https://github.com/urbit/urbit)!  You need an invitation to join the network.  But not to play with the interpreter, or even send a PR.

(Why is Urbit still invite-only?  Because bugs.  Global flag days, etc.  We ship no code before its time.)
